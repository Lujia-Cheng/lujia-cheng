    <h2>
      Hi, glad to see you here! I&apos;m a Master of Information Science student
      at the University of Pittsburgh, set to graduate in May 2024. I actually
      majored in Chemistry and Philosophy during my undergrad at Virginia Tech
      and have worked as a chemist for a brief period.
      <br />
      <br />
      However, I&apos;m now transitioning into a career in software development.
      I&apos;ve discovered a passion for programming, finding it more rewarding
      than lab work. The immediate feedback of a compiler is certainly
      preferable to a failed three-day experiment!
      <br />
      <br />
      Interestingly, my interest in programming stemmed from one of my chemistry
      graduation requirements: intro to Java. Yep, even chemists at Virginia
      Tech require programming skills. Later, I discovered the MMO game{" "}
      <Link href="https://screeps.com/">Screeps</Link>. In this game, you code
      your own AI bot (non-generative, of course) in JavaScript to establish a
      base, mine resources, and build an army to fight against other players. I
      found it fascinating, which is how I got into programming.
      <br />
      <br />
      I&apos;ve spent quite a bit of time refining my AI chatbot. Feel free to
      check it out in another tab! You can also connect with me on LinkedIn
